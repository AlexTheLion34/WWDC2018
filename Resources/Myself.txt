Hello again, my name is Aleksey Petrenko. I am a second-year student from Saint-Petersburg, Russia. Last summer I decided for myself, that I want to learn how to develop applications for IOS and become a developer in the nearest future. Luckily, I had some money from birthday presents and my savings which made an opportunity to buy MacBook Air. At that moment my journey to the world of IOS started. I’ve been studying programming since the 10th form (in our country there are 11), so I hadn’t been struggling with learning a new language - Swift, but it had amazed me with it’s cool features like optionals, closures and etc. I try to improve my skills in Swift language everyday, and I hope it will help me in the future.
