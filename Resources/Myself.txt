Hello again, my name is Aleksey Petrenko. I am a second-year student from Saint-Petersburg, Russia. Last summer I decided for myself, that I want to learn how to develop applications for IOS and become a developer in the nearest future. Luckily, I had some money for birthday and my savings which gave an opportunity to buy a MacBook Air. At that moment my journey to the world of IOS started. Iâ€™ve been studying programming since the 10th grade (in Russia there are 11), so it wasn't difficult to learn a new language - Swift, besides it amazed me with its cool features like optionals, closures and etc. I try to improve my skills in Swift language every day, and I hope it will help me in the future.
