Basketball is my passion. I enjoy both playing and watching it. Specifically, I’ve been playing basketball professionally for six years. I’ve won the Championship of Saint-Petersburg two times and our team was placed on the fourth place in Russia. When it is about to watch basketball, I definitely choose NBA. I am a huge fan of the league and try to watch Playoffs every year as well as watching highlights and recaps every day trough the season. My dream is to visit the NBA game one day.
