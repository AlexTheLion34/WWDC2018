With passion for basketball comes passion for sneakers. It all started from basketball shoes. Every August, before the start of basketball season I was looking for some stuff to buy like Lebron’s, Kobe’s or KD’s. The day of buying new sneakers was always a high day. After having finished playing basketball professionally, I became passionate about lifestyle sneakers and especially retro Jordan’s. I’ve got four of them in my collection already hoping to increase this amount to as many as possible in the future.
