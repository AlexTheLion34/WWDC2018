With passion to basketball comes passion to sneakers. It all started from basketball shoes. Every August, before the start of basketball season I was looking for some stuff to buy like Lebron’s, Kobe’s or KD’s. The day of buying new sneakers was always a high day. After finished playing basketball professionally, I became passionate of lifestyle sneakers and especially retro Jordan’s. I’ve got four of them in my collection already hoping to increase this amount to as much as possible in the future.
