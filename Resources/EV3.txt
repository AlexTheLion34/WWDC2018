Since I’ve entered the university, I’ve become involved in robotechnics. Trough the first term we had been working with LEGO Mindstorms NXT. I was very excited about the fact, that my code made some real things to perform different actions. It had influenced me so much, that I decided to buy this LEGO for myself. Once, I’ve created a vehicle from it, I decided to reboot the system to get the ability to program it on Java. I’ve written some regulators to my robot, which made him driving around my flat from every room to another. My wish is to create a robot, that could write or draw something.
