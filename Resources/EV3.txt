As soon as I entered the university, I became involved in robotechnics. During the first fall semester we were working with LEGO Mindstorms NXT. I was very excited about the fact, that my code made some real things to perform different actions. It had influenced me so much, that I decided to buy this LEGO for myself. When I created a vehicle out of it, I decided to reboot the system to have the possibility to program it on Java. Iâ€™ve written some regulators to my robot, which made him drive around my flat from one room to another. My wish is to create a robot, that can write or draw something.
