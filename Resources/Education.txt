Since 10th grade I’ve been involved in programming and Information Technologies, so when I finished Physical Technical High School (PTHS), there was no doubt which university to choose. I entered the ITMO University. It is a famous place, because our students quite often win the ACM ICPC - world championship in programming, and participate in many other activities. I study Computer Science, Robotechnics and Engineering. The system of grades in the ITMO is not typical for Russia (we can score 100 points per semester by each subject and only 20 of them are for exams, so you can receive a «good» mark without having examinations).
