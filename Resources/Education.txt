Since 10th form I’ve started enjoying programming and Information Technologies, so when I graduated from Physical Technical High School (PTHS), there was no doubt about which university I should choose. I entered the ITMO University. It is a famous place, because our students quite often win the ACM ICPC - world championship in programming and participate in many other activities. I study Computer Science, Robotechnics and Engineering and as I think, I do quite successfully. The system of marks in the ITMO is not traditional for our country (we can score 100 points per semester by each subject and only 20 of them are for exams, so you can receive a «good» mark without examination).
