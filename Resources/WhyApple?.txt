My acquaintance with Apple products started when I was in the 7th form. My mother bought me an Ipod Touch 4. Since then, almost all gadgets, that surround me are Apple devices. Since 7th form I've had an opportunity to deal with two Ipods, Ipad, two Iphones and, finally a MacBook. I love this production because of the design, simple usage and brilliant support team. In addition to it, there is one thing, that stands out. It is optimization. It so cool that every device could work five or more years without losing its power. I am glad, that now I have a possibility to develop software for Apple devices.
